                        <p>Solheimajokull glacier is an outlet from the mighty Myrdalsjokull and is surrounded by some of Iceland's most grand volcanoes and during summertime, a glacier lagoon forms in front of the glacier, only adding to the charm of the location. This popular day tour is the perfect way to get in contact with the real reason behind the name Ice-land! </p>
